        Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia as an offshoot of an earlier
        encyclopedia project, Nupedia, in January 2001. Originally, Wikipedia was created 
        to provide content for Nupedia. However, as the wiki site became established it
        soon grew beyond the scope of the earlier project. As of January 2015, the 
        website provided well over five million articles in English and more than that
        number in all other languages combined. At that same time, Alexa ranked 
        Wikipedia as the seventh-most popular site on the Internet. Wikipedia was 
        the only non-commercial site of the top ten.

      Criticisms of Wikipedia include assertions that its openness makes it
      unreliable and unauthorative. Because articles don't include bylines, 
      authors aren't publicly accountable for what they write. Similarly, because 
      anyone can edit any article, the site's entries are vulnerable to unscrupulous 
      edits. In August 2007, Virgil Griffiths created a site, WikiScanner, where users 
      could track the sources of edits to Wikipedia entries. Griffiths reported that
      self-serving edits typically involved whitewashing or removal of criticism of a 
      person or organization or, conversely, insertion of negative comments into the 
      entry about a competitor. Wikipedia depends upon the 
      vigilance of editors to find and reverse such changes to content.
